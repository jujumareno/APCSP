//page6 questions

// 1. based on the observation the ant would speed up if i put the speed to 500.
// 2. when i decrese pheromoneEvaporationRate, pheromoneDepositRate the blue doesnt become thicker as if if i increased it high. i found out a steady speed prduces more colonies.
// 3. if tthe enviroment cell size was altered by 10 to 15 there i would see something diffrerent in the simulation
// 4. A hypotheses i can make when i increase the food code decrese the ant speed the ants will still move at a fast rate
// 5. The most foraging behaviors were once with a fairly high ant population and high food and home pheromone deposite rate.
// 6. if i wanted to make this model more real world i would add preditors like, grasshopers, roach, ant-eater etc.
// 7. No qu4eestions.
